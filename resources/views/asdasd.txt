    Develop a basic Blog module in Laravel. 
    Begin by creating a migration for a blog_posts table that includes 
    the fields: id, title, content, and timestamps and author.

    Proceed to design a Blade view containing a form with input fields for the blog title and content, 
    and configure it to submit via a POST request to /blog/save. 
    In this route, implement data insertion into the database using the insert. 
    After the data is saved, redirect the user to the /blog route, where all posts shall be retrieved and presented as JSON.
